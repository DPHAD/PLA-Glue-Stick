# PLA-Glue-Stick
This is a simple 3D model to 3D print a "glue stick" out of plastic. The idea is to use a glue gun to extrude molten plastic instead of hot glue.

See https://wp.me/pk3lN-1dUM for the full story. In short, I used a high temperature glue gun with a "glue stick" 3D printed from PLA instead of a real glue stick. As a result, the glue gun uses PLA instead of hot glue. This file is the 3D model I used to print the "glue stick" out of PLA.

This 3D model has notches in it to engage the feed arm on my glue gun, an 80W "Surebonder" high temperature gun from Amazon.
However, different gun models may have different feed systems. YMMV.  I printed mine at 75% infill, oriented with the ramps of the notches pointing "down" so that supports aren't needed.
